# Define a function that takes one integer argument and 
# returns logical value true or false depending on if the integer is a prime.

# Per Wikipedia, a prime number (or a prime) is a natural number 
# greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

# Requirements
# You can assume you will be given an integer input.
# You can not assume that the integer will be only positive. 
# You may be given negative numbers as well (or 0).
# NOTE on performance: There are no fancy optimizations required, 
# but still the most trivial solutions might time out. 
# Numbers go up to 2^31 (or similar, depends on language version). 
# Looping all the way up to n, or n/2, will be too slow.




# A prime number is a number that can only be divided by itself and 1.
